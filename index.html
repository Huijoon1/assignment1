	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Ideal job</h3>
			<p>The position of my ideal job is a software engineer, and it is appealing to me because of the following reasons. The first reason is that the job outlook for a software engineering career is so amazing and the median pay for software engineers is very high. In order to be a software engineer, communication with team members is very important and basic coding skills must be supported. Currently, I have basic coding skills such as Java, Python, and C, and these three basic languages are enough to start my career as a software engineer. Since one of the most challenging aspects of the job is finding out the right things to use to solve a particular problem that I encounter as I work in a team, I need to take initiative in my team. Also, according to the advertisement, merging new information with something that really makes sense for users is the most challenging thing, so It is necessary to develop the ability to cope with situations and communicate with users.</p>

			<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
			<p>
				According to the results of the three personality tests, I am a defender, a tactile learner, a conscientious person, and a sympathetic person. In a team, As the results of the three tests show, I never take an initiative when I work on a project within a team. However, I do my best to play my role given by the project leader. As I am a defender and a sympathetic person, I am not good at acting as a leader, giving roles to others. If they say they won't be able to do it well while talking about their grievances, I cannot speak firmly but sympathize with them, doing their roles all by myself. Therefore, the project won't be proceeded in a right path. So, when forming a team, I need to find someone who is determined and good at role distribution. Also, as a tactile and a "hands-on" learner, I usually learn and understand things through physical activity. I also need to be active and take frequent breaks in order to do well. Therefore, I need to form a team or proceed a project involving physical activities or meetings.

			<h3>Project Idea</h3>
			<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p>The IT project I am thinking of is a facial mask detection. By using a computer software, I would like to detect people devoid of masks. This project can be used with CCTV placed in public places such as movie theaters, offices, or shopping malls. The software I will be using is Cifar-10 Image classification software, and it can be used with deep learning algorithms. CNN, Convolutional Neural Network learning technique will also be used to detect people's facial information and extract those images and send those information immediately. By detecting such people with no masks, it will be very useful to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in public places and end this long pandemic. </p>

			<h4>Motivation</h4>
			<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic, our lifestyle has changed, and it has become our daily routine to go out wearing facial masks. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, wearing facial masks becomes very crucial that many governments and organizations are ensuring the usage of facial masks. Because still a lot of people walking outside do not wear masks these days, I am aiming to detect people devoid of masks. According to OWID, there are an average of three million COVID-19 confirmed cases per day, which means the spread does not seem to be disappeared. This is the motivation of the IT project.  </p>
			
			<h4>Description</h4>
			<p>Facial mask detecting project is a project to determine whether or not someone is wearing a mask. In this COVID-19 pandemic, wearing facial masks has become our daily routine not to spread the virus, so this project is crucial to prevent the spread. there are various object detection systems introduced. For example, in medical applications, deep learning algorithms are widely used, and in predicting crime rates, by using machine learning and the linear regression algorithm, it is possible to predict the percentage of crimes that can occur in the future. Deep learning architectures have recently demonstrated a significance in object detection. These architectures can be used to detect a mask on a person's face. Thus, this IT project's goal is to detect facial information, to determine the presence or absence of a facial mask and to prevent the future spread of the virus.  </p>
			<p>To begin with, CCTV cameras are utilized to gather real-time video footage of various public locations throughout the city. Facial images are taken from the camera clip, and these images are used to identify the mask on the face. The learning technique Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to extract features from images, and subsequently numerous hidden layers learn these features. When the architecture detects people without a face mask, the information is sent to the appropriate authorities via the city network, who will take the appropriate action. The proposed system evaluated promising output based on data gathered from various sources. In this pandemic case, we also represented a system that can assure adequate law enforcement on persons who are not following fundamental health requirements.</p>
			<p>So, as I said above, the Cifar-10 dataset and keras library of Python, and the Cifar-10 dataset is a widely used computer vision dataset for image recognition. It's a subset of the 80 million tiny pictures dataset, comprising 60,000 3232 color images divided into 10 item groups, each with 6000 photos. There are 50000 photos for training and 10,000 images for testing. And keras is a Python-based neural network library that is open-source. It has the ability to run on top of TensorFlow, which makes things easier for us. In comparison to tensorflow and other deep learning frameworks, Keras is a lot easier to use. This is why keras is being used in this project.</p>
			<p>Deep learning systems can classify images fairly correctly. In this project, we'll use the Cifar-10 dataset and Python's keras package. Ten types of photos in the cifar-10 dataset. We can use keras to design a CNN model and submit the dataset for training. With those various types of images and photos, it will be easier to classify people's faces and images. </p>
			<p>Also, this IT project's goal is to make an automatic system which predicts and offers accurate and timely information on people's information. We utilize machine learning, genetic, soft computing, and deep learning methods to evaluate massive data for systems. These algorithms have the potential to be extremely effective in predicting correct data and images with minimal complexity. </p>

			<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
			<p>In the project, the Cifar-10 dataset software, deep learning, and image preprocessing techniques will be used. Since the main goal of the project is to classify people with masks or without masks in this COVID-19 pandemic, using the Cifar-10 dataset software is the most important software of the project. Moreover, by using deep learning systems and keras library, automated systems will predict and offer accurate information through CCTVs in public places. Also, Convolutional Neural Network technique will be used to extract features from images in distance. After extracting information, it will be sent to the appropriate authorities via the city network, who will take the appropriate action.</p>

			<h4>Skills Required</h4>
			<p>Since the project needs the Cifar-10 dataset and some computer science techniques such as deep learning and image preprocessing techniques, Android Studio, Java, Garmin, PHP, XML, Python, and the sklearn library are required skills. Sklearn library is really useful library for machine learning in Python, and it provides efficient tools for machine learning like statistical modeling via a consistence interface in Python. Since it provides classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction through Python, it is required software for the project. Also, garmin is very important tool in this project because it is specialized in GPS technology for automotive. Since people's facial information has to be recorded, GPS technology is very important tool. </p>

			<h4>Outcome</h4>
			<p>If the project is successful using such software and required skills, this project will prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus effectively by detecting people devoid of masks. If governments' supports, such as strengthening punishment for walking around without wearing a mask, the project's automated systems will enable more effective monitoring of people's wearing masks. Then, people will no longer come out without wearing masks, and it will naturally prevent people from the exposure to the virus. Furthermore, since there are not many things to do but implementing the automated systems, it will be easy for other countries to use the systems as well. </p>
